2D LOAD PACKER FREE
======================================================

There is only a program executable - 'pack2dfree.exe'. To run this free program version, you'd also download regular program installation pack - '2D Load Packer 30-day Trial version', install it and place above executable file in the main program folder - next to the regular executable 'pack2d.exe'. 

Then you can run either trial - 30 days, or time unlimited free program version. Just note that free version is limited in box/container item total quantity, so some trial task samples are non-working. Please create your own tasks.
