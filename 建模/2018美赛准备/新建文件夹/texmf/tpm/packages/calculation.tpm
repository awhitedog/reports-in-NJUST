The notion of reasoned calculations or calculational proofs was originally advocated by Wim Feijen and Edsger Dijkstra. The package accepts options fleqn and leqno (with the same effect as LaTeX options fleqn and leqno, and inherits these from the document class). It allows steps and expressions to be numbered (by LaTeX equation numbers, obeying the LaTeX \label command to refer to these numbers), and a step doesn't take vertical space if its hint is empty. An expression in a calculation can be given a comment; it is placed at the side opposite to the equation numbers. Calculations are allowed inside hints although numbering and commenting is then disabled.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="11079">texmf\tex\latex\calculation\calculation.sty texmf\tpm\packages\calculation.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="112538">texmf\doc\latex\calculation\calculation.pdf texmf\doc\latex\calculation\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="9305">texmf\source\calculation-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1421182801</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>0e837d47b42f094291d2309ed13ec1ec</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/calculation"/><TPM:Copyright owner="Maarten Fokkinga" year="2014-2015"/><TPM:License type="lppl1.3"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
