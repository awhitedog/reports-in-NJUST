The package requires the array package, and needs e-TeX to run (since array.sty is present in every conforming distribution of LaTeX, and since every publicly available LaTeX format is built using e-TeX, the requirements are provided by default on any reasonable system). The tabu environment may be used in place of tabular, tabular* and tabularx environments, as well as array in maths mode. It overloads tabularx's X-column specification, allowing a width specification, alignment (l, r, c and j) and column type indication (p, m and b). \begin{tabu} to &lt;dimen&gt; specifies a target width, and \begin{tabu} spread &lt;dimen&gt; enlarges the environment&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;natural&amp;#8221; width.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="119138">texmf\tex\latex\tabu\tabu.sty texmf\tpm\packages\tabu.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="2466486">texmf\doc\latex\tabu\README texmf\doc\latex\tabu\tabu.pdf</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="75492">texmf\source\tabu-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1298898899</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>22d1ff7d22d665b4e2ae40bd52a175d8</TPM:MD5></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
