Other attempts (such as tex4ht) failed because they all needed an extra step to go from xml to Braille, and this step (say, with liblouis) produced incomprehensible output (liblouis focuses in Office apps). Our main target was the Greek language which is only Braille level 1, but English at level 1 is supported as well. Simple pictures in PSTricks are also supported in order to produce tactile graphics with specialized equipment. Note that embossing will need LibreOffice and odt2braille as this project does not deal with embossersâ€™ drivers.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="7962336">texmf\scripts\latex2nemeth\latex2nemeth-v1.0.1.jar texmf\tpm\packages\latex2nemeth.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="102019">texmf\doc\support\latex2nemeth\examples\mathpics.tex texmf\doc\support\latex2nemeth\examples\mathtest.tex texmf\doc\support\latex2nemeth\examples\nemeth.json texmf\doc\support\latex2nemeth\gpl-3.0.txt texmf\doc\support\latex2nemeth\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="7844">texmf\source\latex2nemeth-src.tar.xz</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1512162110</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>3acb42abfdb742abf108e65b985cc341</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/support/latex2nemeth"/><TPM:License type="gpl3"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
