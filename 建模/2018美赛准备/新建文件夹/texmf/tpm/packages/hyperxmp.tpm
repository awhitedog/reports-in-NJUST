The metadata is designed to be easy to extract, even by programs that are oblivious to the document's file format. Most of Adobe's applications store XMP metadata when saving files. Now, with the hyperxmp package, it is trivial for LaTeX document authors to store XMP metadata in their documents as well. Version 2.2 of the package added support for the IPTC Photo Metadata schema. It allows \xmpcomma and \xmpquote to be used in any hyperxmp option, not only those that require special treatment of commas. And it introduces an \xmplinesep macro that controls how multiline fields are represented in the XMP packet. The package integrates seamlessly with hyperref and requires virtually no modifications to documents that already exploit hyperref's mechanisms for specifying PDF metadata. The current version of hyperxmp can embed the following metadata as XMP: title, authors, primary author's title or position, metadata writer, subject/summary, keywords, copyright, license URL, document base URL, document identifier and instance identifier, language, source file name, PDF generating tool, PDF version, and contact telephone number/postal address/email address/URL. Hyperxmp currently embeds XMP only within PDF documents; it is compatible with pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, LaTeX+dvipdfm, and LaTeX+dvips+ps2pdf.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="37615">texmf\tex\latex\hyperxmp\hyperxmp.sty texmf\tpm\packages\hyperxmp.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="601651">texmf\doc\latex\hyperxmp\hyperxmp.pdf texmf\doc\latex\hyperxmp\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="108464">texmf\source\hyperxmp-src.tar.xz</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1513630922</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>8ec421f2e981833276ba8ae4bb5ec6e8</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/hyperxmp"/><TPM:Copyright owner="Scott Pakin" year="2017"/><TPM:License type="lppl1.3c"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
