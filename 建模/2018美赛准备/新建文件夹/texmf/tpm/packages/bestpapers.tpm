The same requirement is often stated for reports prepared by professional teams. The creation of such lists may be a cumbersome task. Even more difficult is it to support such lists over the time, when new papers are added. The BibTeX style bestpapers.bst is intended to facilitate this task. It is based on the idea that it is easier to score than to sort: We can assign a score to a paper and then let the computer select the papers with highest scores. This work was commissioned by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, United States Treasury. This package is in the public domain.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="36280">texmf\bibtex\bst\bestpapers-export.bst texmf\bibtex\bst\bestpapers.bst texmf\tpm\packages\bestpapers.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="170826">texmf\doc\bibtex\bestpapers\bestpapers-guide.pdf texmf\doc\bibtex\bestpapers\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="6622">texmf\source\bestpapers-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1445979719</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>553eaebe7f733626d00d617fb7f8897d</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/biblio/bibtex/contrib/bestpapers"/><TPM:License type="pd"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
