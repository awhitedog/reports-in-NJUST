It is an important update of the axodraw package, but since it is not completely backwards compatible, we have given the style file a changed name. Many new features have been added, with new types of line, and much more flexibility in their properties. In addition, it is now possible to use axodraw2 with pdfLaTeX, as well as with the LaTeX-dvips method. However with pdfLaTeX (and also LuaLaTeX and XeLaTeX), an external program, axohelp, is used to perform the geometrical calculations needed for the pdf code inserted in the output file. The processing involves a run of pdfLaTeX, a run of axohelp, and then another run of pdfLaTeX.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="138505">texmf\tex\latex\axodraw2\axodraw2.sty texmf\tpm\packages\axodraw2.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="417796">texmf\doc\latex\axodraw2\axodraw2-man.pdf texmf\doc\latex\axodraw2\example.tex texmf\doc\latex\axodraw2\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="54524">texmf\source\axodraw2-src.tar.xz</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1495310486</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>ea60b437efa97d1ca41045461ad3ddfc</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/graphics/axodraw2"/><TPM:Copyright owner="John Collins and Jos Vermaseren" year="1994-2016"/><TPM:License type="gpl3"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
