At the center of these algorithms were new ideas about the relationships between structures expressable as mathematical sets and relations. Using the language of mathematics and logic, the researchers communicated these new results to others in their community via published papers, research talks, etc. Unfortunately, they found the symbols already available for reasoning about relations lacking (in contrast to sets, which have a long-ago developed and robust symbol vocabulary). Early presentations were unnecessarily cluttered. To more elegantly express these ideas around relations, Cook recruited artist Tauba Auerbach to help develop a set of symbols. This package provides an math symbol font for describing relations between ordered pairs by using Metafont.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="51615">texmf\fonts\map\dvips\esrelation\esrelation.map texmf\fonts\source\public\esrelation\esrelation.mf texmf\fonts\source\public\esrelation\esrelation10.mf texmf\fonts\type1\public\esrelation\esrelation10.pfb texmf\tex\latex\esrelation\esrelation.sty texmf\tex\latex\esrelation\uesrelation.fd texmf\tpm\packages\esrelation.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="162737">texmf\doc\fonts\esrelation\esrelation.pdf texmf\doc\fonts\esrelation\README texmf\doc\fonts\esrelation\README.md</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="7063">texmf\source\esrelation-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1432584001</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>85cd4e0996b9c02b3b732833222cc8d8</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/fonts/esrelation"/><TPM:License type="lppl1.3"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
