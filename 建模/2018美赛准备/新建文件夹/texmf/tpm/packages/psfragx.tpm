Each time a graphic is included, the EPS file is scanned. If some tagged lines are found, they are used to define the psfrag replacements that should be performed automatically. In addition, a similar mechanism holds for overpic objects. These are picture objects superimposed on the included graphic. A similar mechanism is implemented in psfrag itself (but deprecated in the documentation), but psfragx offers much more flexibility. For example, if babel is used, it is possible to define different replacements corresponding to different languages. The replacements to take into account will be selected on the basis of the current language of the document. A Matlab script (LaPrint) is provided, to export an EPS file with psfragx annotations ready embedded.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="15564">texmf\tex\latex\psfragx\psfragx.cfg texmf\tex\latex\psfragx\psfragx.sty texmf\tpm\packages\psfragx.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="247973">texmf\doc\latex\psfragx\Examples\psfragx_example.pdf texmf\doc\latex\psfragx\Examples\psfragx_example.tex texmf\doc\latex\psfragx\psfragx.pdf texmf\doc\latex\psfragx\README texmf\doc\latex\psfragx\readmePFX.txt</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="214244">texmf\source\psfragx-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1336766402</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>8e230c7c5f0942fa2c6445d41054cca1</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/psfragx"/><TPM:Copyright owner="Pascal Kockaert" year="2003-2012"/><TPM:License type="lppl"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
