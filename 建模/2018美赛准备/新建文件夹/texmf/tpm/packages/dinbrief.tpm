A style file for LaTeX 2.09 (with limited support of the features) is part of the package. Since the letter layout is based on a German standard, the user guide is written in German, but most macros have English names from which the user can recognize what they are used for. In addition there are example files showing how letters may be created with the package. A graphical interface for use of the dinbrief is provided in the dinbrief-GUI bundle.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="66376">texmf\tex\latex\dinbrief\dinbrief.cfg texmf\tex\latex\dinbrief\dinbrief.cls texmf\tex\latex\dinbrief\dinbrief.sty texmf\tpm\packages\dinbrief.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="483664">texmf\doc\latex\dinbrief\dinbrief.pdf texmf\doc\latex\dinbrief\readme</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="57340">texmf\source\dinbrief-src.tar.xz</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1468604647</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>2e15a9d41b3f9174e7ad2b633b62d6bf</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/dinbrief"/><TPM:License type="lppl"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
