The package helps to get the information needed for grid setting. It does not implement auto grid setting, but there is a command \vskipnextgrid, that moves to the next grid position. This may be enough under some circumstances, but in other circumstances it may fail. Thus gridset is only one more step for grid setting, not a complete solution.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="20744">texmf\tex\latex\gridset\gridset.sty texmf\tpm\packages\gridset.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="122125">texmf\doc\latex\gridset\gridset.pdf</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="6674">texmf\source\gridset-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1245527005</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>9f80917603792957b787cc811d960640</TPM:MD5></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
