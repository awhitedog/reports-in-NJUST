It is a response to comments on an answer at TeX Stack Exchange (http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/236410/) requesting sample package files for others to copy. I had previously assumed these were too trivial to be of interest, but if they would be useful, then I would prefer them to be generally available via CTAN.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="22752">texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Acorn.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\AnnSton.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\ArtNouv.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\ArtNouvc.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Carrickc.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Eichenla.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Eileen.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\EileenBl.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Elzevier.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\GotIn.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\GoudyIn.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Kinigcap.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Konanur.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Kramer.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\MorrisIn.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Nouveaud.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Romantik.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Rothdn.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Royal.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Sanremo.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Starburst.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Typocaps.sty texmf\tex\latex\cfr-initials\Zallman.sty texmf\tpm\packages\cfr-initials.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="685206">texmf\doc\latex\cfr-initials\cfr-initials.pdf texmf\doc\latex\cfr-initials\manifest.txt texmf\doc\latex\cfr-initials\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="3166">texmf\source\cfr-initials-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1429615131</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>439dc985e0b306d79d5f0342eacc5694</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/cfr-initials"/><TPM:Copyright owner="Clea F.
