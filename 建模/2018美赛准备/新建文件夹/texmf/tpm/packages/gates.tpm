Thus complex code may easily be customised without having to rewrite it, or even understand its implementation: the behavior of existing gates can be modified, and new ones can be added, without endangering the whole design. This allows code to be hacked in ways the original authors might have never envisioned. The gates package is implemented independently for both TeX and Lua. The TeX implementation, running in any current environment, requires the texapi package, whereas the Lua version can be run with any Lua interpreter, not just LuaTeX.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="53255">texmf\tex\context\gates\t-gates.tex texmf\tex\generic\gates\gates.lua texmf\tex\generic\gates\gates.tex texmf\tex\latex\gates\gates.sty texmf\tpm\packages\gates.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="265768">texmf\doc\latex\gates\gates-doc.pdf texmf\doc\latex\gates\gates-doc.txt texmf\doc\latex\gates\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="1433">texmf\source\gates-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1338321607</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>3b496a6b1e94c80ca38f18870c4f5a6a</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/generic/gates"/><TPM:License type="lppl"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
