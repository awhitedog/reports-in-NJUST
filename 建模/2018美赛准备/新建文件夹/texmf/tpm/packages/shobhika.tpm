It is available in two weights—regular and bold. The font is designed with over 1600 Devanāgarī glyphs, including support for over 1100 conjunct consonants, as well as vedic accents. The Latin component of the font not only supports a wide range of characters required for Roman transliteration of Sanskrit, but also provides a subset of regularly used mathematical symbols for scholars working with scientific and technical documents. The project has been launched under the auspices of the Science and Heritage Initiative (SandHI) at IIT Bombay, and builds upon the following two fonts for its Devanāgarī and Latin components respectively: (i) Yashomudra by Rājya Marāṭhī Vikās Saṃsthā, and (ii) PT Serif by ParaType. We would like to thank both these organisations for releasing their fonts under the SIL Open Font Licence, which has enabled us to create Shobhika.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="702601">texmf\fonts\opentype\public\shobhika\Shobhika-Bold.otf texmf\fonts\opentype\public\shobhika\Shobhika-Regular.otf texmf\tpm\packages\shobhika.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="37905">texmf\doc\fonts\shobhika\AUTHORS.txt texmf\doc\fonts\shobhika\CONTRIBUTORS.txt texmf\doc\fonts\shobhika\Copyright.txt texmf\doc\fonts\shobhika\OFL.txt texmf\doc\fonts\shobhika\README.md texmf\doc\fonts\shobhika\sample\shobhika.pdf texmf\doc\fonts\shobhika\sample\shobhika.tex</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1498852913</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>bf6446490582baae664b92f1dac207c9</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/fonts/shobhika"/><TPM:License type="ofl"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
