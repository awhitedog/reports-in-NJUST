Using this class, postgraduate students at HEC Montréal will be able to write their dissertation or thesis while complying with all the presentation standards required by the University. This class is meant to be as flexible as possible; in particular, there are very few hardcoded features except those that take care of the document’s layout. Dissertations and theses at HEC Montréal can be written on a per-chapter or per-article basis. Documents that are written on a per-article basis require a bibliography for each of the included articles and a general bibliography for the entire document. The hecthese class takes care of these requirements. The class depends on babel, color, enumitem, fontawesome, framed, numprint, url, and hyperref.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="13531">texmf\tex\latex\hecthese\hecthese.cls texmf\tpm\packages\hecthese.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="496879">texmf\doc\latex\hecthese\hecthese.pdf texmf\doc\latex\hecthese\README.md</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="18316">texmf\source\hecthese-src.tar.xz</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1512162110</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>d16d6fb03e2fbfd0ae35f670e65bfb6d</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/hecthese"/><TPM:Copyright owner="HEC Montreal" year="2017"/><TPM:License type="lppl1.3c"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
