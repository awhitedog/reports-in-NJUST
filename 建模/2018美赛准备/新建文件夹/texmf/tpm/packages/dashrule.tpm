Because dashrule's rules are constructed internally using \rule (as opposed to, e.g., PostScript \specials) they are fully compatible with every LaTeX back-end processor.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="3308">texmf\tex\latex\dashrule\dashrule.sty texmf\tpm\packages\dashrule.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="258192">texmf\doc\latex\dashrule\dashrule.pdf texmf\doc\latex\dashrule\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="6089">texmf\source\dashrule-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1365451200</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>5f5d91d8c47cef0d0924a64752b8a952</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/dashrule"/><TPM:License type="lppl"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
