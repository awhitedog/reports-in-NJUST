The package is built using pgf, and shares that systems large demands for TeX system memory. Its geometric commands are based on a turtle graphics model, and control structures such as loops and conditionals are available.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="39551">texmf\tex\latex\sseq\sseq.sty texmf\tpm\packages\sseq.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="215050">texmf\doc\latex\sseq\sseq.pdf</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="16181">texmf\source\sseq-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1378756801</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>b07dd7c645ec9e4868d9eacfe4729d0b</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/sseq"/><TPM:License type="lppl"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
