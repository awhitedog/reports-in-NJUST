The user records data in a text file and specifies as arguments of the macros the date range of interest. The macros extract the relevant information from the file and process it: \swimgraph produces a graph of the times in a single swimming event (specified as an argument), plotting long course and short course times in separate lines. Records and qualifying times, stored in text files, may optionally be included on the graph. \swimtext produces a written record of the times in all events. Files of current world and Canadian records are included. The package requires the PSTricks and keyval packages. For attractive output it also requires a colour output device.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="50405">texmf\tex\latex\swimgraf\swimgraf.cfg texmf\tex\latex\swimgraf\swimgraf.sty texmf\tpm\packages\swimgraf.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="138385">texmf\doc\latex\swimgraf\100br1.pdf texmf\doc\latex\swimgraf\100br2.pdf texmf\doc\latex\swimgraf\README texmf\doc\latex\swimgraf\swimgraf.pdf texmf\doc\latex\swimgraf\text1.pdf texmf\doc\latex\swimgraf\text2.pdf</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="3440">texmf\source\swimgraf-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1329819664</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>41b0dcc3e81dcb271599dc1537c77e82</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/swimgraf"/><TPM:License type="lppl"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
