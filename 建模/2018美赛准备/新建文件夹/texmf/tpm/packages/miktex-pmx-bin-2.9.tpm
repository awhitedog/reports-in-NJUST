It has most of MusiXTeX's functionality, but it also permits in-line TeX to give access to virtually all of MusiXTeX. For proof-listening, pmxab will make a MIDI file of your score. scor2prt is an auxiliary program that makes parts from a score. </TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="662131">texmf\miktex\bin\miktex-pmxab.exe texmf\miktex\bin\miktex-scor2prt.exe texmf\tpm\packages\miktex-pmx-bin-2.9.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1509285768</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>7304ec2e8c8b5ee866c42bbc14a9f75d</TPM:MD5><TPM:Copyright owner="Don Simmons" year=""/><TPM:License type="gpl3"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
