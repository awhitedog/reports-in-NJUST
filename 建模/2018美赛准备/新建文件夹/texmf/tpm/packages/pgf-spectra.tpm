It is based on the package pst-spectra, supporting the same options, but also adding some new options. It relies on PGF/TikZ for drawing the desired spectrum, continuous or discrete. As in pst-spectra, there are data available for the spectra of 99 elements and their ions (from the NASA database). It also allows the user to draw spectra using their own data.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="37225">texmf\tex\latex\pgf-spectra\pgf-spectra.sty texmf\tpm\packages\pgf-spectra.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="591892">texmf\doc\latex\pgf-spectra\pgf-spectraManual.pdf texmf\doc\latex\pgf-spectra\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="72433">texmf\source\pgf-spectra-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1461700927</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>f39c59d32c522fe1c1a2bbaf014fd230</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/graphics/pgf/contrib/pgf-spectra"/><TPM:License type="lppl1.3"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
