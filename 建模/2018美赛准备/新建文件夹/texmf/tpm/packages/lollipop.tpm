Its main aim is to make macro writing so easy that implementing a fully new layout in TeX would become a matter of less than an hour for an average document. The aim is that such a task could be accomplished by someone with only a very basic training in TeX programming. Thus, Lollipop aims to make structured text formatting available in environments where typical users would switch to WYSIWYG packages for the freedom that such a mechanism offers. In addition, development of support for Lollipop documents written in RTL languages (such as Persian) is underway.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="204531">texmf\tex\lollipop\config\lollipop.ini texmf\tex\lollipop\tex\lollipop-define.tex texmf\tex\lollipop\tex\lollipop-document.tex texmf\tex\lollipop\tex\lollipop-float.tex texmf\tex\lollipop\tex\lollipop-fontdefs.tex texmf\tex\lollipop\tex\lollipop-fonts.tex texmf\tex\lollipop\tex\lollipop-heading.tex texmf\tex\lollipop\tex\lollipop-lists.tex texmf\tex\lollipop\tex\lollipop-output.tex texmf\tex\lollipop\tex\lollipop-plain.tex texmf\tex\lollipop\tex\lollipop-text.tex texmf\tex\lollipop\tex\lollipop-tools.tex texmf\tex\lollipop\tex\lollipop.tex texmf\tpm\packages\lollipop.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="328623">texmf\doc\generic\lollipop\lollipop-manual.pdf</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="47119">texmf\source\lollipop-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1464202078</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>fdfe986d36ba3436c6c2d15a5224e067</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/lollipop"/><TPM:Copyright owner="Vafa Khalighi" year="2014-2016"/><TPM:License type="gpl3"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
