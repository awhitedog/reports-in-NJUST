Within the definition text of an inlined definition, keywords such as \Expand may be used to selectively inline certain expansions at definition-time. This eases the process of redefining macros in terms of the original definition, as well as definitions in which the token that must be expanded is deep within, where \expandafter would be difficult and \edef is not suitable. Another application is as an easier version of \aftergroup, by defining a macro in terms of expanded local variables, then ending the group with \expandafter\endgroup\macro.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="11831">texmf\tex\latex\inlinedef\inlinedef.sty texmf\tpm\packages\inlinedef.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="155458">texmf\doc\latex\inlinedef\inlinedef.pdf texmf\doc\latex\inlinedef\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="13727">texmf\source\inlinedef-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1215852287</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>d7d2713a6b53f89f0df9ef46bfc4686f</TPM:MD5></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
