It automatically aligns the problems in three points with an optional fourth: Beginning of the words “minimize/argmin” and “subject to” The objective function and the longest left hand side of the constraints The $= | &gt; | &lt;$ signs of the constraints. Optionally, the user can add manually a double align character &amp;&amp; to align some common constraints feature. A clear example could be the constraints names, e.g. (boundary constraint) alignment with (dynamic constraint). Furthermore, it provides an easy interface to define optimization problem for three different reference situations: Where no equation is referenced/numbered. Where the problem is referenced with a single number. Where each equation has an individual reference. Finally, it also allows a definition of any optimization problem without a limitless number of constraints.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="22252">texmf\tex\latex\optidef\optidef.sty texmf\tpm\packages\optidef.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="288721">texmf\doc\latex\optidef\optidef.pdf texmf\doc\latex\optidef\README.md</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="8984">texmf\source\optidef-src.tar.xz</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1512162110</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>a99934009348838465a9b8d11373ef9e</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/optidef"/><TPM:Copyright owner="Jesus Lago Garcia" year="2016-2017"/><TPM:License type="lppl1.3"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
