While it does not duplicate all the features of the official package, this package is more user-friendly in several ways. Most notably, Asymptote errors are repackaged as LaTeX errors, making debugging less of a pain. It also has a more robust mechanism for identifying unchanged pictures that need not be recompiled.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="13022">texmf\tex\latex\asypictureb\asypictureB.sty texmf\tpm\packages\asypictureb.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="637909">texmf\doc\latex\asypictureb\asypictureB.pdf texmf\doc\latex\asypictureb\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="15477">texmf\source\asypictureb-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1398283201</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>ad6f43a4930cc6769bdb28e246ea6fb7</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/graphics/asypictureb"/><TPM:Copyright owner="Charles Staats III" year="2014"/><TPM:License type="lppl1.3"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
