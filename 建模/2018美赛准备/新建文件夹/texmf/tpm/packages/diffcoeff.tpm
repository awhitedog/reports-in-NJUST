For mixed partial derivatives, the overall order (algebraic or numeric) is calculated by the package. Optional arguments allow the easy specification of a point of evaluation for ordinary derivatives, or variables held constant for partial derivatives, and the placement of the differentiand (in the numerator or appended). Some tweaking of the display is possible through key = value settings. Secondary commands provide analogous coefficients constructed from D, \Delta and \delta and a command for writing Jacobians. diffcoeffx.sty is diffcoeff.sty ‘on steroids’, extending that package in ways that are probably unnecessary but have a certain logical force. The packages require the LaTeX3 bundles, l3kernel and l3packages.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="51288">texmf\tex\latex\diffcoeff\diffcoeff.sty texmf\tex\latex\diffcoeff\diffcoeffx.sty texmf\tpm\packages\diffcoeff.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="985756">texmf\doc\latex\diffcoeff\diffcoeff.pdf texmf\doc\latex\diffcoeff\diffcoeffx.pdf texmf\doc\latex\diffcoeff\README.txt</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="22878">texmf\source\diffcoeff-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1467227668</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>8045f1e8403bbdeec0d33cf7050d08dd</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/diffcoeff"/><TPM:License type="gpl2"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
