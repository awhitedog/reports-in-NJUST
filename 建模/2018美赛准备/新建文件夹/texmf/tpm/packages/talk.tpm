It also allows you to print personal notes for your talk. You can create overlays and display structure information (current section / subsection, table of contents) on your slides. The main feature that distinguishes talk from other presentation classes like beamer or prosper is that it allows the user to define an arbitrary number of slide styles and switch between these styles from slide to slide. This way the slide layout can be adapted to the slide content. For example, the title or contents page of a talk can be given a slightly different layout than the other slides. The talk class makes no restrictions on the slide design whatsoever. The entire look and feel of the presentation can be defined by the user. The style definitions should be put in a separate sty file. Currently the package comes with only one set of pre-defined slide styles (greybars.sty). Contributions from people who are artistically more gifted than me are more than welcome!</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="17605">texmf\tex\latex\talk\sidebars.sty texmf\tex\latex\talk\talk.cls texmf\tpm\packages\talk.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="143865">texmf\doc\latex\talk\README texmf\doc\latex\talk\talkdoc.pdf</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="8723">texmf\source\talk-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1187026996</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>daf9590f315a704d5711ac6a5bee8a9d</TPM:MD5></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
