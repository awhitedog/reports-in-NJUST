      for header/footer and page dimensions. Most common paper sizes,
      paper orientation, disabling of headers and footers, and two
      sided printing are supported. The vmargin package does not rely
      on other packages and was designed with speed and size in
      mind. Its user interface might not be very fancy, but it's fast,
      small, and gets the job done. If you are looking for something
      more elaborate try the geometry
      package.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="8300">texmf\tex\latex\vmargin\vmargin.sty texmf\tpm\packages\vmargin.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="39012">texmf\doc\latex\vmargin\vmargin.dvi</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="10645">texmf\source\vmargin-src.cab</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1090520962</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>ad25a8ae692c5fbcda146df5cd3f49f0</TPM:MD5></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
